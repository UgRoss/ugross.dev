### Similarities

- Both are primitives
- Both are falsy:
  - ```text
    Boolean(undefined) //-> false
    Boolean(null) //-> false
    ```

### Differences

- `undefined` means that a variable has not been declared, or it has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
- `null` is an assignment value that means “no value”. Javascript itself never sets a value to `null`
- Difference in `typeof`:
  - ```text
    typeof null; //-> "object"
    typeof undefined; //-> "undefined"
    ```
- `undefined` is not a valid JSON while `null` is.

### Tips

- Check if a variable is `null`:

```javascript
variable === null;
```

- Check if a variable is `undefined`:

```javascript
typeof variable === 'undefined';

// ⬇️ or this, but will throw ReferenceError if variable wasn't defined
variable === undefined;
```

- Comparison \(Equality returns `true` and identity returns `false`\) :

```javascript
undefined == null; //-> true

undefined === null; //-> false
```
