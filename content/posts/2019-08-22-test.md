![My Workspace](/blog-images/workspace.jpg 'My Workspace')

Inspired by other people sharing their workspace photos and description, I thought it'd be fun to share my own setup of home-office workstation.
I find very interesting to read what people use to do their work, it allows to find ideas or refresh own setup.

Let's get started!

##### MacBook Pro 2017

On an everyday basis, I use my MacBook Pro 15‚Äù 2017. This laptop allows me to work no matter where am I, furthermore provides comfortable work even without a mouse.

On my desk, it stands on [TwelveSouth HiRise for MacBook](https://www.twelvesouth.com/product/hirise-for-macbook) to be
on the same level with a monitor.

##### LG 4K Display

My main screen is the [27 inch UHD 4K Monitor | LG 27UD69P | LG UK](https://www.lg.com/uk/monitors/lg-27UD69P), it has an adjustable height feature which I find very useful
in combination with a height-adjustable Desk. In addition, it supports orientation change but I use it very rarely.
As for now, I don't feel I need two monitors, my MacBook plays the role of a second one where I can keep less important windows.
On the LG monitor, I usually keep code editor and browser windows to check my work.

##### Height-Adjustable Desk

Everyday sitting is damaging our body, so I decided to build an electric height-adjustable desk based on [Conset 501-33](https://www.conset.com/product/prodone/5097/default.aspx) and custom light-colored countertop.
Not to say that I spend a lot of time standing but it helps to increase productivity a bit. In addition, you can dance while listening to music üòÄ.

##### Custom PC

The main purpose of the PC is to play games in my free time or to run Linux when I'm bored with Mac OS.

##### Other Stuff:

-   üéß **Headphones**: Apple AirPods. Pretty cool combination to a Mac or iPhone.
-   üñ± **Mouse**: Logitech MX Master. Simply the best mouse I ever had. It has hot-keys configuration with which you can configure your mouse to switch between windows or desktops same fast as on touchpad or Apple Mouse.
-   ‚å®Ô∏è **Keyboard**: Logitech K760. Old but still good. The only thing I'm feeling not comfortable with is missing music control keys.
-   üß∞ **Multi-port adapter**: [Satechi Type-C multi-port adapter](https://satechi.net/products/satechi-slim-aluminum-type-c-multi-port-adapter?variant=27296854025). It's still painful to have only type-c ports. Note that it doesn't support 4k@60.
-   üì¶ **NAS**: [Synology DiskStation DS218j](https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS218j). Backups and Media storage.
-   üéí **Bag**: Thule EnRoute Triumph 2 Daypack, Dark Shadow. My must-have thing when I go outside. It has only 24 liters but it‚Äôs enough for me to put everything into it even for a small few-days travel.
-   üñ± **Mouse #2**: Apple Magic Mouse 2. I‚Äôm using it rarely as after MX master I don‚Äôt find this mouse to be comfortable.
-   **Chair**: Unknown office chair. Going to replace it someday with an orthopedic one.
